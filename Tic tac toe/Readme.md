                                **Tic-tac-toe game**
                                ***User Manual***
     
     
     This is my first python project as a beginner.I made a basic tic-tac-toe version 1
     **How to use**
     When the program starts computer will ask you which team you wanna choose i.e (X or O).
     When you select your team you will be directed to your play area where u can see some marking 
     on the position of the tic-tac-toe board when your turn will come you will have to just enter the 
     desired marking and your X or O will go there..
     **Rules of the game**
     a) If your X or O will be filled horizontally vertically or slantly then you will win else
     loose
     b) Each opponent will get only one chance for his turn
     
     
     thats it in the user manual
     Version 2 is comming in the next version I m going to add the play with computer option also.
     Working on it.
